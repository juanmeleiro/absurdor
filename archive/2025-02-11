EVENTS SINCE LAST REPORT

A lot of pushes, pushed by the need of some nearly inactive players to
show some activity. Remember!: we must imagine Sisyphus happy, and be
so in our struggle to continue not being inactivated.

THE VEBLEN

          The Veblen
          is owned by Ben
          and costs 21 spendies

          It is shiny.
          It is round (and thus pointless).
          It is admired.
          It has infinite points and is thus no longer pointless.
            (N.B. do note that that's a circle)
