The implementation has now grown to be almost unmanageable. I have to
refactor a lot of it. If anyone would like to help or give suggestions,
that would be welcome. Find the repo page at:

THE VEBLEN

          The Veblen
          is owned by Ben
          and costs 21 spendies

          It is shiny.
          It is round (and thus pointless).
          It is admired.
          It has infinite points and is thus no longer pointless.
            (N.B. do note that that's a circle)
